  <strong>Requirements:</strong>
Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to bring in and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.  (We will provide instructions on setting up the required software several days in advance)
<em> There are no pre-requisites, and we will assume no prior knowledge about the tools.</em>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop, 
  you will need working copies of the software described below.
  Please make sure to install everything and try opening it to make sure it works 
  <em>before</em> the start of your workshop. If you run into any problems,
please feel free to email the instructor or arrive early to your workshop on 
the first day.
  
Participants should bring and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of 
tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.

<b>
For this workshop you will need to:
<ul>
<li>Download the data for the workshop from <a href=https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172>https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172</a>
<li>Install Anaconda, so you have Python and the Jupyter notebook, following the directions below
</ul>
</b>

<h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
    </p>

    <p>
      We will teach Python using the Jupyter notebook, a programming environment
      that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all supported
      (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
      and below, are not).
